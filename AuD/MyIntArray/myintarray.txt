Write a class MyIntArray with different methods:

The method 

public static int[] createRandom(int n) 

takes the size of the array to be generated as parameter. The elements of the array will be filled with random integer numbers within the range of 5 to 99.

Hint: to generate random numbers use the standard function random from the class Math. The instruction 
int z = (int)(maxrand*Math.random()); generates a random number z within the range of 0 and maxrand (0 <= z < maxrand)

public static String toString(int[] a) 

returns the elements of a in a String. Test your toString(...) in the main method and also print the array with the predefined method java.util.Arrays.toString(...).

public static int posMin(int[] a) 

returns the position of the smallest number in a. If the smallest element occurs more than once, only the first position of that number is to be returned.

public static void swap(int[] a)

swaps the first and the last element in a.

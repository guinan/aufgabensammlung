Interpret a recursive function I

Look at the following function:

Algorithm: f(x,y)
Input:     x,y ganzzahlig
Output:    ?
   if y = 0 then x
            else f(x-1, y-1)
   fi

Describe how the function is evaluated using different examples. What does this function compute? For which values does the algorithm not terminate?
Think about how to extend the algorithm for that it terminates for all integer values. Implement your extended algorithm as a Java method

    public static int rek(int x, int y).

Additionally implement your enhanced algorithm as an iterative method 
  
  public static int iter(int x, int y).

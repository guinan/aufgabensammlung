The Simpsons fight

Look at the following two rekursive algorithms (n is a natural number starting at 0)

Algorithm: marge(n)
Input:     n ganzzahlig, n>=0
Output:    ?
   if n = 0 then 1
            else n - homer(marge(n - 1))
   fi

Algorithm: homer(n)
Input:     n ganzzahlig, n>=0
Output:    ?
   if n = 0 then 0
            else n - marge(homer(n - 1))
   fi

The function dispute computes whether the Simpsons fight on their wedding anniversary:

Algorithm: dispute(n)
Input:     n ganzzahlig, n>=0
Output:    ?
   not(marge(n) = homer(n))

Implement the algorithms above as Java methods

    public static int marge(int n)

    public static int homer(int n)

    public static boolean dispute(int n)

How does the difference of the fights on the anniversaries develop? The Simpsons fight on the zeroth and first anniversary. Hence, the difference between the fights is 1 (one year). Write a method

public static int [] differenceDisputes(int x)

that determines the first x difference between fights on wedding anniversaries. Can you recognize the rules or the sequence of numbers, respectively?
Write a test frame within the main method to answer the following questions:
Do the Simpsons fight on their copper (copper or wool wedding - after 7 years) or silver wedding anniversary or are they at peace?
Do Homer and Marge get along better or worse as the years pass?

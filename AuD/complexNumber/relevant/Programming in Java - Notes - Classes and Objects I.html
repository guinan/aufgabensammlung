<h1>Classes and Objects</h1>

<h2>Class Definition And Object Instantiation</h2>
<p>
When we define a class, we define the components and the behavior of a
type of object.  As an example, let's take a complex number.  Our
complex number will have two pieces of data - its real and imaginary
components.  It's class definition, without any methods yet, would
look something like:
</p>

<pre>public class Complex
{
    public double real;
    public double imag;
}
</pre>

<p>
This says that every Complex object we create will have two doubles
inside of it, called real and imag.  (you can ignore the "public" till later
in this lesson, but basically it means that anyone who can see a given
Complex can get or set the values of real and imag in that Complex)</p>

<p>
Next, we want to add some methods
to the class - behavior of the objects of the class.  In general, a
method looks like this:
</p>

<pre>access_modifier return_type method_name( arguments... )
{
    one or more statements 
}
</pre>

<p>
access_modifier is either public, protected, private, or can be left
out.  It defines what objects can execute the method.  
return_type is any valid type - one of the 8 fundamental types, any
defined object type, or "void".  It specifies what the method call
evaluates to in the code that calls it.  We say that this is what it
<em>returns</em>.  method_name is any word composed of letters, numbers
and underscores, beginning with a letter or underscore.  You should
stick with the convention of starting with a lowercase letter,
reserving words starting with an uppercase for class names.  The
arguments can be zero or more pairs of type and argument name (any
word), seperated by commas.  
</p>

<p>
The first methods we want to add are constructors, which are used to
build the objects.  We'll add one that doesn't set real and imag, but just leaves them 0,
and another that sets them with arguments passed to the constructor:
</p>

<pre>public class Complex
{
    public double real;
    public double imag;

    public Complex() {}
    public Complex(double r, double i)
    {
        real = r;
	imag = i;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
Take note of a few things here.  First, constructors are the one kind
of method for which no return type is specified.  This is because the
constructor always operates to create an object of the given type,
Complex in this case.  Second, note how the arguments work by looking
at the second constructor.  Here we declare that two doubles will be
passed in to this constructor, and we will call them r and i from
within the body of the constructor.  
</p>

<p>
Now, we could create Complex objects and set their values two
different ways.  We could construct empty objects and set 
the values seperately:
</p>

<pre>Complex c = new Complex();
c.real = 1.5;
c.imag = -2.3;
</pre>

<p>
Or we could do it in one step using the second constructor:
</p>

<pre>Complex c = new Complex(1.5, -2.3);
</pre>

<p>
In either case, the new operator sets aside enough memory for a
Complex object, passes it to the constructor, which in the second case
fills in the values, and then returns the location of the object in
memory, which is used to set c,
a Complex reference.  It is important to understand here that c is
just a reference - it refers or points to the area in memory that
actually holds the data.  In this case:
</p>

<pre>Complex c = new Complex(2.1,1.4);
Complex b = c;
</pre>

<p>
there is now only one Complex object in memory, which is referred to
by two seperate references.  When we do:
</p>

<pre>c.real = 5.6;
System.out.println(d.real);
</pre>

<p>
we see that 5.6 is printed out.  This is because the first line says
to set the real part of <em>the object referred to
by c</em> to 5.6, and that object is the same that is referred to by
d.  So, when the second line says to print the real part of <em>the
object referred to by d</em>, we get 5.6.
</p>

<p>
Now let's make some methods other than the constructor.  In
particular, let's make a magnitude method to get the magnitude of a
complex number, and an add method to add a second complex number to
the first and return the sum:
</p>

<pre>public class Complex
{
    public double real;
    public double imag;

    public Complex() {}
    public Complex(double r, double i)
    {
        real = r;
	imag = i;
    }

    public double magnitude()
    {
        return Math.sqrt(real*real + imag*imag);
    }
    public Complex add(Complex other)
    {
        return new Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
When inside of these methods, real and imag refer to the real and imag
components of the object in question.  So, when we create a Complex
and ask for its magnitude:
</p>

<pre>Complex c = new Complex(3.0,4.0);
System.out.println(c.magnitude());
</pre>

<p>
the magnitude method is called on the Complex we created, where real
is 3.0 and imag 4.0, so c.magnitude() evaluates to the double value
5.0, which println prints out.  Note that we call a method on an
object by writing the reference name, followed by a period, followed
by the method name, followed by parenthesis, possibly containing
arguments to the method.
</p>

<p>
The add method takes the real and imag values from the Complex it is
called on, adds them to the values from the Complex passed to the
method, and uses them to construct a new Complex object, which it
returns.
So, we might use it like this:
</p>

<pre>Complex a = new Complex(-1.0,2.0);
Complex b = new Complex(3.0,4.5);
Complex c = a.add(b);
</pre>

<p>
Which would result in c referring to a Complex with real of 2.0 and
imag of 6.5.  
</p>

<h2>Packages</h2>
<p>
When building real life java code, classes will often be grouped into
<em>packages</em>.  This is a way of placing together certain related classes
and of allowing certain grouped classes to have special access
privileges with each other.  To declare a class part of a package, use
the package keyword before the class definition.  For instance, if we
wanted to make Complex part of the myMath package, we would specify
that like so: 
</p>

<pre>package myMath;

public class Complex
{
    ....
}
</pre>

<h2>Accessibility Modifiers and Encapsulation</h2>
<p>
There are four levels of accessibility, in increasing order: private,
package, protected and public.  These are applied to the class
defintion, the components of the class and the methods of the class.
For now, you'll just always make one class in a file, and make it
public, so don't worry about visibility in the class definition.  For
components and methods, visibility determines whether a given piece of
code can access the component or execute the method.  Private
visibility is the most restrictive.  A private component or method can
only be accessed from methods within the class definition.  For
instance, let's say we defined the class Foo like so:
</p>

<pre>public class Foo
{
    private int i;

    public int getI() { return i; }
    public void setI(int _i) { i = _i; }
}
</pre>

<p>
Now, the getI and setI methods can access the i component of the Foo
object in question because they are inside the definition of Foo, but
from outside they cannot be accessed, so the following would not compile:
</p>

<pre>Foo f = new Foo();
f.i = 7;             // this line will cause a compiler error
                     // because the i component is private
</pre>

<p>
The setI and getI methods effectively allow access to the i component,
but provide a place that we can monitor that access, as well as
allowing us to change the actual internals of Foo without breaking
outside code - we might have the actual integer hidden in a database
somewhere for instance.  Hiding components and then providing access
through special methods is called <em>encapsulation</em> and is an
important technique in object-oriented programming.
</p>

<p>
If we don't specify the visibility of a component or method, it gets
package visibility.  This means that it can be accessed from methods
of the class and from methods of other classes in the same package as
the class, so if we defined:
</p>

<pre>package widgets;

public class Warble
{
    double d;

    public double getD() { return d; }
    public void setD( double _d ) { d = _d; }
}
</pre>

<p>
then not only can getD and setD access d because they are methods of
Warble, but methods of any other classes in the widgets package can
also access d on a Warble object.  For instance, this is ok:
</p>

<pre>package widgets;

public class Blurble
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Warble w = new Warble();
	w.d = 5.9;               // this is ok because Blurble
                                 // is in the widgets package
    }
}
</pre>

<p>
The next visibility is protected visibility.  Components and methods
with protected visibility can be accessed from within the same class,
from within methods of classes in the same package, and from within
methods of subclasses of the given class.  Don't worry yet what this
means.  Thats another lesson..
</p>

<p>
Finally, public visibility means that components and methods of
objects of the given class can be accessed by any code with a
reference to the given object.  So if we have:
</p>

<pre>public class Sample
{
    public int i;
}
</pre>

<p>
Then any code can feel free to do:
</p>

<pre>Sample s = new Sample();
s.i = 75;
System.out.println(s.i);
</pre>


<h2>Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>
When you create an object, for instance:
</p>
 
<pre>Foo f = new Foo();
</pre>

<p>
memory is set aside by the new operator for that object.  In some
other languages, like C++, you need to explicitly delete the object in
order to get the memory back.  In Java, you don't.  Java uses what is
called a <em>garbage collector</em>, which looks for unreferenced
objects and returns their memory to the system.  So, in Java, all you
need to do to give back the memory from an object is drop your
references to it, for instance by assigning the reference to a new
object, or to null, meaning no object, like:  
</p>

<pre>f = null;   // drop the reference to the Foo object we created
</pre>

<h2>The Class Path </h2>
<p>
When java code is compiled or run, it needs to know where to look for
class definitions.  It generally will look in the current directory,
and you can avoid dealing with the classpath for now by just keeping
everything in the current directory and not using packages,
but you might also want it to look other places.  You can get it to
look other places by setting your CLASSPATH environment variable.
Environment variables are special variables that you can set from the
shell to give information to programs or to use in the shell
yourself.  How to set environment variables is different depending on
your shell (and your OS).  On a UNIX machine, your shell is probably
bash or tcsh.  You can tell by typing:
</p>

<pre>&gt;echo $SHELL
</pre>

<p>
which happens to find out by printing the value of the SHELL
environment variable.  If your shell if bash, you set CLASSPATH like so:
</p>

<pre>&gt;export CLASSPATH=.;~/java;~/code/java
</pre>

<p>
or, if your shell is tcsh:
</p>

<pre>&gt;setenv CLASSPATH .;~/java;~/code
</pre>

<p>
On Windows, you have to do it through the GUI and MS seems to have had 
fun making how you do it different on every Windows version.  Good luck.
</p>

<p>
Either way, this says to look for class definitions in three places:
the current directory, the java directory off your home directory (~/
always means your home directory), and the code directory off your
home directory.  Note that the directories are seperated by semicolons.
</p>

<p>
If you put your classes into packages, then they need to be in
directories off the classpath according to the packages.  So, if you
defined your class Blurble to be in the widgets package, then
Blurble.java should be in a widgets directory off any directory in the
classpath, for instance, in ~/java/widgets.

class ComplexNumber

Mathematics I is required!

Write a class ComplexNumber. The real and imaginary parts are of type double.

Apart from a suitable constructor
public ComplexNumber(double re, double im)
and the methods 
public ComplexNumber add(ComplexNumber k)
    and
public ComplexNumber mult(ComplexNumber k)
the method public double absoluteValue() should return the value of the complex number.
Extend the class with the method
public ComplexNumber sqrt() throws InvalidInputForSquareRoot
which returns the square root of the complex number if the imaginary part is 0. Otherwise the method should throw the exception InvalidInputForSquareRoot 
Use the main method to create instances of ComplexNumber and test all methods.

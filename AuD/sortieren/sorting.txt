Sorting

Explain how the sorting algorithms insertion sort and selection sort  you heard about in the lecture work and what the differences between these two algorithms are.
Which of boths sorting methods is stable? Explain why.
Thoughts on insertion sort: How does complexity of sorting change, if the index in the array where the element is inserted is not computed linear but with binary search?

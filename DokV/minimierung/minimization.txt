assignment 4: minimization

Considering the following examples, can you decide if those are potentially valid SGML documents without knowing the SGML declaration and DTD?


a) <a><b><a><b>

b) <a></a><b></b>

c) <a><a></a></b>

d) <a><b></a><b>

e) <b></a><a><c></b><b>

If possible, define for each construct a DTD that conforms with the example. The elements <a>, <b> and <c> are enclosed by a root element <test> whose start and end tags have to be existant.

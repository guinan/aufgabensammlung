Assignment 19: Fibonacci

The Fibonacci series is a mathematical series of positive integers - the fibonacci numbers. Each number is the sum of the two preceeding numbers: 

      0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

Generally speaking, the Fibonacci numbers can be defined as follows:


             / 0                                for n = 0
    Fib(n) = |  1                               for n = 1
             \ Fib(n - 1) + Fib(n - 2)          otherwise

Implement the function Fib(n) as XSL template. Use the given answer template. 
A faster way to compute the fibonacci numbers is based on the idea, that we could return two successive values as result of the function at once:

    fibPair n = (fib n, fib (n+1))

A given value pair (u,v) results in the successive pair (v, u+v) using fibStep:

    fibStep (u,v) = (v, u+v)

fibPair can then be defined as:

    fibPair (0) = (0,1)
    fibPair (n) = fibStep(fibPair (n-1))

Finally we can compute the Fibonacci number n efficiently as:

    fastFib n = first ( fibPair n)

(first returns the first element of the tuple)

Implement the function fastFib (and necessary helper functions) as XSL template.

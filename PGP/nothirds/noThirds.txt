 noThirds and limos

 The function noThirds assigns a list to an arbitrary list list1, which results from list1 if you remove the third, sixth, nineth ... element (all elements on positions that are multiples of 3).

 Write noThirds only with the help of recursion and pattern matching, but without using predefined list functions or arithmetic functions.

 The predicate limos (= 'length is multiple of seven') is true if the length of the listen is a multiple of 7.
 Write limos only with the help of recursion and pattern matching, but without using predefined list functions (like length) or arithmetic functions.

 Additional question: In what way would you have to change limos to gain a function limos3mod7 which is true if the length of a list is a multiple of 7 or resulting in a rest of 3 when you divide the length of the list by 7?

 Symbolic Differentiation

 Extend the scheme program deriv for symbolic differentiation from the lecture (Jun 18 2013) such that it contains rules for handling integer exponentiation.

 Hint: An exponentiation like (x to the power of 4) could be represented as

 (^ x 4)

 What does your version of the program return the derivative of x or y for the polynomial

 x (to the power of) 4 + x * y (to the power of) 3 ?

deepReverse

Define a Prolog predicate deepReverse(L1,L2) mirroring L1 not only on the topmost level, but mirrors recursively all lists that might be included as elements.
deepReverse(L1, L2) is true exactly when L2 is the mirror image of L1 including contained sublists. You must not use the standard predicate reverse(L1,L2).

example: deepReverse([1,2,3,[4,6]],L) returns L = [[6,4],3,2,1]

Try to find a preferably efficient algorithm. Estimate the number of necessary computing steps.
Submit at least one interaction example (as comment) together with your solution.
